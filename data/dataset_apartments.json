It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Just six minutes south of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus, Savoy is a suburb that offers great access to the college town. But Savoy has its own perks to attract renters seeking apartments. The suburb is slowly growing and working to improve the town year by year. There are currently plans in motion to add more parks and improve traffic infrastructure. Savoy has a low cost of living and the housing is affordable. The schools are good as well, luring in families looking to raise children in a small town. Conveniently, Savoy has a direct connection to several metropolitan areas through three local Interstate highways. The town has Willard Airport on the southern edge of town for locals who like to travel.\n                        Savoy has all the entertainment of a classic American small town. Indulge in nostalgia at Old Orchard Lanes and Links, an old-school style bowling alley with mini golf, or Skateland roller rink. Catch a 3D movie at GQT Savoy 16 or sing you heart out at Star Karaoke.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Savoy",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Just six minutes south of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus, Savoy is a suburb that offers great access to the college town. But Savoy has its own perks to attract renters seeking apartments. The suburb is slowly growing and working to improve the town year by year. There are currently plans in motion to add more parks and improve traffic infrastructure. Savoy has a low cost of living and the housing is affordable. The schools are good as well, luring in families looking to raise children in a small town. Conveniently, Savoy has a direct connection to several metropolitan areas through three local Interstate highways. The town has Willard Airport on the southern edge of town for locals who like to travel.\n                        Savoy has all the entertainment of a classic American small town. Indulge in nostalgia at Old Orchard Lanes and Links, an old-school style bowling alley with mini golf, or Skateland roller rink. Catch a 3D movie at GQT Savoy 16 or sing you heart out at Star Karaoke.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Savoy",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus.

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Just six minutes south of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus, Savoy is a suburb that offers great access to the college town. But Savoy has its own perks to attract renters seeking apartments. The suburb is slowly growing and working to improve the town year by year. There are currently plans in motion to add more parks and improve traffic infrastructure. Savoy has a low cost of living and the housing is affordable. The schools are good as well, luring in families looking to raise children in a small town. Conveniently, Savoy has a direct connection to several metropolitan areas through three local Interstate highways. The town has Willard Airport on the southern edge of town for locals who like to travel.\n                        Savoy has all the entertainment of a classic American small town. Indulge in nostalgia at Old Orchard Lanes and Links, an old-school style bowling alley with mini golf, or Skateland roller rink. Catch a 3D movie at GQT Savoy 16 or sing you heart out at Star Karaoke.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Savoy",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus.

The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus.

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "There's much more to Champaign's sister city of Urbana than you might think. It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus.

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

It is a lively college town, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, it has a long and fascinating history, and it is family-friendly and beautiful. While it is usually tied to its next-door twin, Urbana stands out on its own -- Downtown Urbana is the city hub, home to Market at the Square, a farmers market that began in 1979. The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus. The neighborhood attracts those with children, thanks to its top-ranking schools, and it features beautiful parks, such as Crystal Lake Park and Meadowbrook Park.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Urbana",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

  "neighborhoodDescription": "Located at the intersection of Interstates 57, 72, and 74 in east central Illinois, Champaign deftly skirts the line between small town and college town. The University of Illinois largely defines the city, with nearly 45,000 students enrolled (the city’s population totals around 85,000); as a result, Champaign is home to a growing sector of tech startups and other entrepreneurial endeavors growing out of the university’s research community and recent graduates.\n                        The rental market includes a number of highly affordable options, including many apartments under $600 per month. Expect your schedule to be packed with community events when you live in Champaign, from the popular and wide-ranging Boneyard arts festival to the Sweetcorn Festival in neighboring Urbana. As the hometown of late movie critic Roger Ebert, Champaign’s historic Virginia Theatre hosts an annual film festival in his honor.\n                \n                \n                    Learn More About Champaign",

The historic downtown features historic architecture, bike lanes (and plenty of bike racks), sidewalk cafes, period lighting, and a wide variety of shops and restaurants.\n                        In addition to the university, Urbana is home to the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, a research institute located on the university's campus.
